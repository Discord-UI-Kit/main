# @yoshiboi18303-discord-ui/core

The core classes and stuff for the UI Kit. It's not recommended to install this.
Instead, install one of our adapters for `discord.js`, `eris`, etc.!

Also, this package is still in development. Only published so I can work on the adapters. Do NOT install this yet!
